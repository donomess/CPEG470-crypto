# CPEG470-crypto
This is a easy crypto problem. 

You will be provided with an encrypted key and flag. 

Your job is to find out what cypher I am using, and decode it. (Hint: Neither are secure, but you can likely decode the key through an online resource.)

For the flag, you would need to change () to {}. Ok. Good luck.
